- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jamesjarviscyber
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in beginning to learn how to code. It's still early days. My code may be basic, but I will endeavour to grow! Alas, most of the code here will be terrible, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. console.log(reality); 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here for now, get in contact if you wish to connect elsewhere.
